The point of this is that you can unzip any file with a single command; no more googling the correct `tar` syntax. 

See [e.rb](./e.rb)

Note you can alternatively use the `7z` command line tool, which is downloadable through `apt` as `p7zip`.

In that case, you can write `7z e <archive_path>` to extract.
